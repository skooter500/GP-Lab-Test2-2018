# Game Programming Lab Test 2 2018

## Rules
- This is an open book test. 
- You can access my git repository, the Processing reference or any of your own notes or sketches, but no other internet usage is allowed. No Facebook, chat or googling. 
- No collaboration
- You have 4 hours to complete the test

Here is a video of the sketch you will be making today:

What is happening:

- Balloons spawn at the bottom of the screen offscreen and rise upwards until they reach the top of the screen. 
- Ballons can be either red, green or blue.
- Balloons have a random size of between 50-80 pixels wide and a random speed of between 1-3.
- When a balloon rises, it should wiggle a bit, similar to the video, but it should never wiggle offscreen.
- When a balloon reaches the top of the screen, it should respawn at the bottom with a new color, size and speed
- The player controlls a pin with the mouse that can be used to pop a balloon by clicking the mouse inside the balloon. You can use the noCursor() to hide the mouse pointer
- When the player pops a ballon, the score increases by 1. 
- The pin must be the correct colour to pop a balloon. For example, if the balloon is red, the pin must be red
- The player can change pin colour by clicking on any of the three colour buttons
- To get full marks in the test, you should use classes, PVector's and arrays or arraylists as appropriate
- To get marks for style & flair, you should implement any additional cool stuff that would enhance the game, such as sound, more beaufiful drawing or enhanced gameplay
